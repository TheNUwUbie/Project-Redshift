# Requirements

You need to have capsolver inorder to solve the funcaptchas.


You will also need proxies in IP:PORT format that can white list capsolvers ip
whitelist this IP address: 47.253.53.46 on what ever proxy provider you have. Make sure the proxies are in IP:PORT format. NOT HOSTNAME:PORT

Currently only Supports HTTPS proxies in IP:PORT format.
I've used this service for a while and haven't had issues other than some of there proxies are dead.
